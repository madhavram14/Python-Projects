Learnt about Object Oriented Programming(OOP) and the interaction of Objects and Classes.A class is like a blueprint that defines the structure and behavior of objects which are referred as the attributes and the methods respectively.Objects are instances of these classes and have unique attribute values. For example if the blueprint of a house is the class, then we can create different house objects where there are attrivutes like color, number of rooms,etc. Methods are like functions to do tasks, for eg; we can create a method to change the color of the room or add a new room. So attrivutes define the state of the house and methods allow actions to be performed on these attibutes. This is also called encapsulation in OOP. OOP basically simplifies complex tasks.
